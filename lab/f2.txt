In recent years, computer technology has developed very rapidly, and the hardware 
conditions are getting better and better. The time used to train deep neural networks 
has been greatly reduced. Deep learning is rapidly becoming an important hotspot of 
scientific research. Deep learning technology is widely used in digital recognition, 
speech recognition, unmanned driving, image recognition, and other fields.  
The new generation of artificial intelligence technology represented by deep learning 
is gradually penetrating people's lives and promoting the development of society. As 
a representative of deep learning technology, the convolutional neural network has 
also developed rapidly in recent years.  
To improve the accuracy of cat breed classification and enable more people to clearly 
understand cat species, this paper cites and compares different deep learning models, 
and compares the performance of VGGNet, Inception-v3, and the optimized deep 
learning model in cat breed recognition. From the experimental results, the accuracy 
of the improved model is about 84%, which is higher than other models. 
Another objective of cat breed detection using Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs) is to accurately classify a given cat image into one of several predefined cat 
breeds. This involves training the CNN on a large dataset of labeled cat images and 
using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen cat images. 
The ultimate goal is to build a model that can accurately identify the breed of a cat 
from an image with high accuracy. This can have several applications, such as 
assisting pet adoption centers in matching potential adopters with the right breed of 
cat, determining the breed of cats in animal shelters and veterinary clinics, and 
identifying the breed of cats in cat shows and competitions. 
Additionally, cat breed detection can also contribute to research and development in 
the fields of animal behavior, genetics, and health, as well as play a role in pet 
insurance by helping to determine the likelihood of certain breed-specific health 
conditions.
